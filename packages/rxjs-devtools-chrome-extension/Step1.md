1 - Read the '../rxjs-devtools-react'.
    - Review the exported API and data structures from 'rxjs-devtools-react'.
    - Identify the communication mechanism (e.g., message passing, direct import, or other integration method).
    - Document any dependencies or setup required to connect the Chrome extension to the React integration.

2 - Understand how the connection works
    - Analyze how data is sent from 'rxjs-devtools-react' to the Chrome extension (e.g., via window messaging, background scripts, or content scripts).
    - Map out the data flow: from the React app, through the integration layer, to the extension.
    - Identify any required permissions or manifest changes (e.g., host permissions, content script injection).
    - Determine if a background script or content script is needed to relay messages.
    - Document the expected message format and lifecycle.

3 - Display the information sent by the integration
    - Design a UI component in the extension popup to render the received data (e.g., a list, table, or tree view).
    - Implement message listeners in the extension (background/content/popup) to receive and process integration data.
    - Ensure the UI updates reactively as new data arrives.
    - Add error handling and loading states for robustness.
    - Write unit/integration tests for the data flow and UI rendering.
    - Document the integration and usage for future maintainers.
    - Add a tab in the chrome inspector called RxJS DevTools
